# Covid19_Data_Analysis_Using_Python
This COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each country. 
Also, there is another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. 
By merging these two datasets, the relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country is found out.
